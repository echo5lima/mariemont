## What to Expect

We all get together on Sundays to worship God. We do this in many ways. We sing songs to God which is a lot like prayers set to music. We share stories or testimonies of God’s love and power. We teach using the Bible as our authority, and from time to time remember the sacrifice Christ made for us through Communion. Our building is handicap accessible.

## The Real Meaning of Church

Most people think the Church is the building. That's an accident of history and translation. When Jesus used the word He meant "people called out"—that is, people called out of normal life to follow Him in an extraordinary adventure.

## Our Beliefs

* **Jesus.** We believe that Jesus is the Son of God - that we can follow Him and be like Him.

* **Holy Spirit.** We believe in the person of the Holy Spirit and that He plays an active role in our everyday life.

* **The Bible.** We believe the Bible is God’s authoritative letter to us, teaching us to live a life worth living now and forever.

* **Surrender.** Jesus gave up His life for us, therefore we should give up our life for Him. 

* **Spiritual Growth.** Growing spiritually is a part of our church life. This means we take steps daily toward spiritual maturity.

* **Shepherding.** Every family has a shepherd to give care and coaching.

* **Intimacy.** We believe prayer and worship are the foundation of our intimacy and relationship with a Father who loves us.

* **Discipleship.** We believe everyone needs Jesus and work to share His love, grace, and gift of salvation with the people we come in contact with. This means discipling. We strive to be disciples making disciples that know how to make disciples.

* **Community.** We believe in community and do not go it alone. Jesus insists on one another-ing. (Yes, that’s a word now.)

* **Serving.** We believe in laying down our lives. This looks like serving our family, friends, and those in need.

* **Kingdom.** We believe in a global commission and investing in Kingdom efforts around the world by praying, giving, and going.
