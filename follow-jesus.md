### Welcome to MC's new resource library. Here we will try to help in three key areas:

#1 Who is Jesus and what is his message?

#2 Six elementary teachings to get started well.

#3 Seven practical skills for every disciple.

### What's included:

- 25 pages of practical, challenging web-based content

- Every section has an email address for questions and counsel

- 20 two-minute videos with Denis and Marianne

- Use as a tune-up, a small group study, for 1:1
