### What We Believe About Students

Did you know that the first youth pastor in the Christian church may have been Jesus. What a lot of people don’t know about Jesus’ original 12 disciples is that it’s quite possible 11 of the 12 of them were teenagers, or at least younger than 20 based on the absence of paying the temple tax mentioned in Matthew 17. The fact that they were following a Rabbi and Jesus’ reference to them as “little ones” or little children” in Matthew 11, Luke 10, John 13 support that they were youth.

The main point we draw from this here at MCC is that there is no junior Holy Spirit. The Father is happy to use anyone who makes themselves available for kingdom works; so when we look at our students, we see Disciples of Jesus with gifting, power, authority, and purpose as disciples of Jesus.

Our Junior High Ministry (7th-8th grade) is called “412” which is taken from the passage in 1 Timothy 4:12: "Don’t let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity."

**Coming to Our Meetings?**

We meet on Wednesday nights in our student ministries room called “The Rock” on the 2nd floor from 7:00 – 8:30 p.m. A typical night consists of food and drinks, some fun games, worship, sharing, and small group breakouts. Many times in these small groups students will encourage, listen to, and pray for each other.
 
We have students who go to Mariemont schools, Turpin schools, MVCA and numerous home-schooled students from various co-ops. We also have some wonderful adult leaders who love Jesus, love students, and have a desire to see students walk more deeply and intentionally with Jesus.

**Who Can Come?**

Any 7th – 8th grade student no matter where you go to school. You don’t have to go to MCC to come on Wednesday nights, in fact, you don’t have to believe in God. This is a safe place to come and explore your faith no matter where you are on your journey. We encourage our students to bring their friends from all walks of life.
