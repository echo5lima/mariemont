### Kids loving Jesus together

412 refers to I Timothy 4:12: "Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.

Our youth group is open to students from 6th-12th grade. We meet weekly after the 11:00 AM service in the PowerHouse on the second floor youth area.

Junior High students have separate learning times led by our teaching team.

### Traveling Ministry Team

**2017**
Each year we form a team of students and parents to serve inner-city children and engage in other ministry field trips and opportunities. If you want to serve, tutor, and have some fun with us please contact Paul Rasmussen at paul@mariemontchurch.org.

In June 2017 our traveling team of junior high, senior high, elementary students and parents went to Bright Star Baptist Church in the West End to serve inner-city children for five mornings. In July students went to Pierre Payen, Haiti where they served at a local orphanage.
