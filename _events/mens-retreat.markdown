When: October 14th – Check in begins at 4:30pm and Check out is at 3:00pm Saturday, October 15th

Why: In this world there is no way we can be united in anything if we are not first united in Christ! Join us as we explore the uniting force Christ can be in all of our lives and how His love can move us to unity in our families, our communities and in our service.

Where: Higher Ground Retreat Center, 3820 Logan Creek Lane, West Harrison, IN 47060 – just 45 minutes from MCC

Who: Men from Mariemont Community Church, Mariemont Church High School Men, New Mission Missionary Baptist Church Men and Friends!

Bring: Bible, notebook, pen, towel, hiking/athletic clothing, toiletries, ear plugs (we have some snorers!), linens or a sleeping bag (this is dorm style and linens are not provided). Bring an open heart and mind to learn more about God’s desire that we be united.

Cost: $75. $20 non-refundable deposit is due to hold your place and the balance is due Sunday, October 9th. If you want to go and money is an issue please contact Rob Seetin at rjseetin @ gmail.com. There are scholarships available. We want you there!
