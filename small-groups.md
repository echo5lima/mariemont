## Small Groups: Where Faith Grows Deep and Relationships Thrive

To be a disciple of Jesus, we realize that we need to constantly grow. A practical way that happens around here is through small groups. We desire people to learn that being the church is not just worshiping for 1 hour on a Sunday morning, but it's seeking His Kingdom daily through community.

Below are existing small groups that would love to welcome you.  Just contact the host to arrange a visit.  Or, if you have or want to start your own group, contact Paul Rasmussen at paul@mariemontchurch.org.  He'd also love to answer any questions you may have about each group.
