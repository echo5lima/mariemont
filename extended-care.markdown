The elementary extended day is a before and/or after school program, which teachers basics simple Christian truths and values for children kindergarten through sixth grade. It is designed to give the parents who work full time a safe and fun learning environment for their children.  While at our center, the children are able to engage in art, manipulatives, games, science, writing and reading activities.  In addition, the children who attend our aftercare program are given a snack, have access to outdoor/indoor physical activity and are given adequate time to do their homework.

The staff and I hope you will find our Preschool and/or elementary Extended Day program a good fit for your child.  Information about our classes, policies, and general information can be found on our webpage.
