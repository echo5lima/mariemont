John kicks off the private ministry of Jesus with a stunning picture and act of love. At the Last Supper, Jesus laid aside His outer garments, kneeled down, and washed His disciples’ feet - even those of the one who would soon betray Him to death. This scene is strikingly intimate, tender, and even uncomfortable as the eternal Word washes dirty, smelly feet. Join us Sunday, as we reflect on John 13:1-20, where Jesus washes His disciples’ feet.
