Jesus says one of the most significant statements about Himself, the Father, and the way to salvation. Jesus declares, “I AM the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6) Make no mistake, this is an exclusive claim by Jesus! All religions and “ways” DO NOT lead to heaven; rather, Jesus is the ONLY way! This truth is absolute, and in our current culture, it is helpful to be reminded again that there are real, solid, eternal, and deep things that are true whether we believe them or not.
