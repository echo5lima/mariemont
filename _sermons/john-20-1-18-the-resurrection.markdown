The Resurrection of Jesus, the Christ! Just to be clear, outside of the Creation event, the Resurrection of Jesus is THE MOST important event in human history. The Resurrection is also the central moment in human history which serves as the foundation for Christianity and is the only hope for a broken and hurting world.

God Himself came in human flesh to die a shameful public death for the sins of the world, and He was raised from the dead in a glorified physical body, triumphant over sin, guilt, and death itself. The Resurrection of Jesus validates His identity as the Son of God and secures for us, as believers, salvation in the present and physical resurrection in the future.

This is a great day to celebrate! Jesus is alive!
