We will witness two contrasting responses to Jesus' miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead. On one hand, many Jews who had witnessed this miracle believed in Jesus, while on the other hand, the religious leaders saw Jesus as a threat to their authority and were determined to put an end to his influence. In the midst of this tension, a dinner is hosted in Jesus' honor at Lazarusâ€™ house. I guess after being raised from the dead, the least you can do is have the Messiah over for dinner! :) During this dinner, Mary, Lazarus' sister, anoints Jesus' feet with expensive perfume, an act of profound devotion and worship.
