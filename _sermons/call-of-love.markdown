Do You Know How to Share Jesus With Your Muslim Neighbors? 
It’s not something most Christians feel confident doing.  How can you share the love of Jesus with a Muslim? The mission of Call of Love Ministries is to help us do exactly that.  

Call of Love started as an underground ministry in the Middle East. But to expand and raise the impact of their efforts, the founders immigrated from the Middle East in 1999 and became a worldwide media outreach (satellite tv, radio, print) whose goal is to disciple the Arab world. 

Their training and resources empower believers in the West to learn about Islam and our Muslim neighbors so they can present Christ effectively. 

Join us on Sunday, April 14th to hear from how God is changing lives in closed Islamic countries as well as the U.S. You will also meet a Christian couple from the Middle East, Abdou and Sally, who obey Jesus’ teaching and face those who persecuted them with His love. Come ready to be challenged and inspired!
