Jesus says one of the most significant statements about Himself, the Father, and the way to salvation. Jesus declares, “I AM the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6) Following this statement, Jesus will begin to teach on the dynamic nature of the Trinity and the believer. The next few chapters of John contain the single greatest teachings about the third member of the Trinity found in the scriptures!
