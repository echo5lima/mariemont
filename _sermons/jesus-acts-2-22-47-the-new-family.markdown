Peter delivers a powerful sermon at Pentecost, proclaiming Jesus as the Messiah and urging repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins, which leads to the addition of about three thousand believers to the Christian community. This passage also describes the early Church’s devotion to the apostles’ teachings, fellowship, communal living, and prayer, marking the beginning of a unified and Spirit-filled Christian movement.
