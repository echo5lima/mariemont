Linger with Jesus in His suffering and pain. Our default mode is to lean toward happy, joyful, celebratory things - and those are good! However, this season allows us the space to join in the suffering of our Savior and Friend, Jesus.

Our journey with JESUS through the Gospel of John is coming to a climax over the next several weeks as we walk through the Passion Narrative. The term “passion” comes from the Latin word patio, which means “to suffer or endure” and this refers to the final moments of Jesus’ life including His betrayal, arrest, suffering, crucifixion, death, and burial.
