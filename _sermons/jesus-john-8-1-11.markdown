bible_text: 1 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 bEarly in the morning he came
  again to the temple. All the people came to him, and che sat down and taught them.
  3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery,
  and placing her in the midst 4 they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught
  in the act of adultery. 5 Now din the Law, Moses commanded us eto stone such women.
  So what do you say?” 6 This they said fto test him, gthat they might have some charge
  to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7
  And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, h“Let him who is
  without sin among you ibe the first to throw a stone at her.” 8 And once more he
  bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 But when they heard it, they went away one
  by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing
  before him. 10 Jesus stood up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one
  condemned you?” 11 She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, j“Neither do I condemn
  you; go, and from now on ksin no more.”
