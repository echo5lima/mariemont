This is the second of seven “I AM” sayings from Jesus in the Gospel of John. Through these seven “I AM” declarations, Jesus identifies as: 1) the bread of life (6:35, 41); 2) the light of the world (8:12; 9:5); 3) the door of the sheep (10:7, 9); 4) the good shepherd (10:11, 14); 5) the resurrection and the life (11:25); 6) the way, the truth, and the life (14:6); and 7) the true vine (15:1, 5).
