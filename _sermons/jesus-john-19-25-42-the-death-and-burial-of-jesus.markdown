Today we witness significant moments during Jesus’ crucifixion and burial. Jesus entrusts His mother Mary to the disciple John, demonstrating compassion even in His suffering. Prophecies are fulfilled as Jesus declares “It is finished,” and His side is pierced. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus prepare Jesus’ body for burial, laying Him in a new tomb near Golgotha, completing His mission of sacrifice and redemption.
