The truth is - then and now - many don’t believe in Jesus. Why? The Bible calls it unbelief. This is a mysterious and deadly fact: many people hear the words of Jesus and even see His ministry of healing and freedom, but still will not believe that He is God, come to save them from their sins.
In this final section of chapter 12, Jesus explains some of what is happening when people don’t believe in Him. In John 12:37-50, the text highlights the stark choice between embracing Jesus as the Light of the world or remaining in spiritual darkness. It emphasizes the need for genuine belief in the Son of God, who is sent by the Father, as the path to salvation and eternal life.
