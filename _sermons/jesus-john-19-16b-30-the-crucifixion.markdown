Today's message is on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. After being handed over by Pilate, Jesus carries His cross to Golgotha, where He is crucified alongside two others, fulfilling the scriptures. Jesus ensures His mother’s care, declares “It is finished,” and upon receiving a drink of sour wine, He bows His head and surrenders His spirit.
