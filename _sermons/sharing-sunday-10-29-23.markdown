"When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up." 
(1 Cor 14:26 ESV)
Basically, this is a service where everyone gets to play and everyone has the opportunity to build one another up! So, come ready to share and be encouraged. Please begin praying now and asking the Father what you can “share” this weekend.
