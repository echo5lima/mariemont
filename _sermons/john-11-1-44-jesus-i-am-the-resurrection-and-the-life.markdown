The public ministry of Jesus is about to come to a close. The religious leaders have repeatedly sought out to kill Jesus, but He has evaded each of their attempts. This last public act - the raising of Lazarus from the dead - is too much for the Jewish leaders. There’s no coming back from this. This miraculous event of resurrection will set into motion the leaders’ plan that will lead to Jesus’ death on the cross.
