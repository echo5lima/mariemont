This weekend we celebrate the Second Sunday of Advent as we make our way to the manger and the Christ-Child. As a reminder, Advent means “coming” and is a season preceding Christmas Day where we reflect on the “coming” of Jesus, both as a Baby first advent) and as a King (second Advent). This is a season of waiting in hope for God to come and be with us forever.
