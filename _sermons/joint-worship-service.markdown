excerpt: "They say that the eyes are the window to the soul\nThere is some truth to
  that,\nBecause not only do our eyes take in our experiences\nThey can tell a story\nYour
  eyes tell YOUR story and HIS story\nI have seen God’s glory covering you\nCovering
  you like a boxer's robe \nYour eyes have the intensity of a fighter\nThe confident
  exterior of a warrior \nHead nodding in silent prayer \nFor the upcoming warfare\nNot
  phased by the enemies stare\nYour eyes are constantly aware\nOf what is going on
  around you in this ring of life\nInstead of throwing your hands \nYou spit fire\nWords
  rage like a viking funeral pyre\nYet, your flow has a hypnotic rhythm and pace\nBobbing
  and weaving through lyrics with grace\nAll in a posture of praise\n\nBecause you
  are still HERE\nBehind your confident exterior used to be fear\nFear that you weren’t
  enough\nFear that you wouldn’t measure up\nFear that you were alone\nAnd wouldn’t
  live long enough to be grown\nFear of sin known and unknown\nThe darkness surrounding\nYour
  heart was pounding, sounding an alarm\nAbout to commit self-harm\n\nWalking a razor
  blade tightrope \nSearching for light, searching for hope\nYou started running FROM
  the lie\nThat you were ready to DIE\nInstead you chose life\n\nDwelling in the shelter
  of the Most High!\nHe will command his Angels concerning YOU!\nTo guard you in all
  your ways\nBecause He has a purpose for the rest of your days\n\nNo more greys,
  your LIGHT is sun-soaked rays\nOozing with praise\nHe prepared you to teach the
  underserved \nHeart so big it’s not easily unnerved \nTeaching students to reach
  for the stars \nAnd reject those jail bars\nWhether literal prison or the twisting
  turning labyrinth of fear and hopelessness\nHe SAVED you for this!\nSaved you with
  His BLOOD\n\nNo need for another flood\nHe put his arms out freely and they nailed...one...two...three\nUnbelievable
  agony all for you and for me\nI mean…\n\n \nThey  say Eyes Are the Windows to the
  Soul \n\nAnd yours Are a Kaleidoscope Of the Creation\n\nI see God Hovering Over
  the Waters Of your Tears With Hope Bursting \nFrom A Broken Bloodline Into The First
  Breath Of A Relationship With Him\n\nThat He has Spoken To exist In you; His Word
  Is Bond.\nAnd His Mouth Is Pregnant; With Every Whisper,\nThe Content Of His Heart
  Toward You Is dilating\n\nStretching \"Let There Be\"To \"It Is Finished\"\n\nLike
  A Cross-Stitched Conversation With Himself From Start To Finish.\n\nHis Death Has
  Wetnursed Your Rebirth Before The Beginning.\n\nAnd since then His Breath Has been
  Spilling Light Into Your lungs Like Suicidal Stars\nDripping From His Lips Into
  The Waterfall Of A First Word\nThat is Washing Unfertilized Confessions Of Who You
  really are. \n\nGardens Can't grow\nGrounded In their Own Guilt.\n\nBut we Forget:
  Pruning Is a process\n\nAnd for years You've flower-bedded Forgiveness For yourself\nInside
  Of a eulogy That never Knew it Could blossom\nWith the Fruit of Your lips. \nFlowers
  Like us know \nThat it hurts To open up. \n\nBut you Did it anyway\nBelieving That
  what Goes Down\nMust come Up, if it's rooted In the right Belief. \n\nSo now, You
  reach Toward Green-housed Heavens\nTo show That first Fruits Don't stay Buried\nBecause
  Cross-Pollinated Seeds Like you And me Always Come Together,\n\nWhen They're Growing
  in The same Direction. \n\n“For the Lord sees not as man sees:\n\nman looks on the
  outward appearance, \n\nbut the Lord looks at the heart.”\n\nSo, Tell Me…\n\nWhat
  do You see?\n\nYou say that you are colorblind...\n\nThat you Wear The Wool\nOf
  Mary's Little Lamb\nOver Your eyes So you Can't see\nSegregated Shades Of lost Sheep\n\nWe
  Graze By faith And not By sight\n\nBut how Are we Supposed To walk the walk\nWhen
  our Gospel Has no Feet?\n\nWe can’t repeat the sins of our fathers\nWho sat idle
  And didn’t take the bridle\n\nThey let Satan lead\n\nWe must take the reins\n\nBecause
  \ His\nBlood is in our veins \n\nSo, We urge \nUs all to…\n\nBear with one \nAnother
  in love\n\nTo maintain... \n\nUnity of \nThe Spirit\n\nOne body, \nOne Spirit,\nOne
  Hope, \n\nOne Lord,\nOne Faith, \nOne Baptism,\n\nOne God and Father of all\nWho
  is over all \nAnd through all and in all.\n"
