Today, we enter into the worship season of “Advent” - which comes from the Latin word for “coming.” This season includes the 4 Sundays leading up to Christmas Day, and is a time to focus on both the first coming (advent) of Jesus (as a baby) AND the second coming (advent) of Jesus (as a victorious king). This “dual-significance” of the season provides a rich opportunity for us to consider violence, pain, sorrow, promise, joy, peace and longing for Jesus.
