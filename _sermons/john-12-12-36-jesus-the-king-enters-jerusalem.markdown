Jesus, the King of the Jews, enters into Jerusalem and is celebrated as the King who is to come and bring freedom from Roman oppression.

Visiting Greeks also come to see Jesus and the mission of the Messiah comes into a broader view: the King of the Jews has come for the whole world. How will this victorious freedom come, though? At what cost? What does it mean to follow Jesus, whether Jew or Greek? 

These are some of the questions we will reflect on this coming weekend. Join us, as we celebrate and praise the One who has come in the name of the LORD, even the King of Israel!”
