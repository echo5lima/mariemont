This weekend we have “Sharing Sunday”. Every 6-8 weeks, we suspend a traditional message, and open up the opportunity for the entire church body to participate in sharing a testimony, a scripture, a prophecy, etc. We do this as a way to obey Paul’s command to the church in Corinth: "When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up." (1 Cor 14:26 ESV)
