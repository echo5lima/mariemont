We are a fellowship of men seeking to forge a Christian Brotherhood by ordering our lives under the comprehensive rule of God so that we can conquer life’s battles shoulder to shoulder.

**We seek to be men that:**

- Hunger for more of God’s Word (Deut 6:6-9)

- Worship and obey the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit with everything we have. (Deut 6:5)

- Love our neighbor as ourselves (Matt 22:39)

- Pray without ceasing. (1 Thes 5:17)

- Serve God, Family, and our communities (1 Peter 4:10)

- Lead our families in the sacrificial example of Christ. (Matt 20:28)

- Love our wives like Christ loved the Church (Eph 5:25)

- Train up our children (Biological, Adopted, or Spiritual) (Proverbs 22:6)

- Train together for Spiritual Warfare (Eph 6:10-17)

- Are disciples that make disciples. (Matt 28:19-20)

- Look out for the widow, orphan, and stranger (James 1:27)

- Work heartily, as for the Lord not for men. (Col 3:23)
