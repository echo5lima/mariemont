    <h2 id="welcome-to-mariemont-church">Welcome to Mariemont Church</h2>

<p>We are a church community that is living and loving in Jesus. Join us every Sunday morning at 9:00 or 11:00 for a time of worship and teaching. Whether you are exploring what it means to have a relationship with Jesus or have already started that journey, there is a place for you here.</p>

<h2 id="kids-and-youth">Kids and Youth</h2>

<p>Our kids and youth ministries are a fun, safe place where kids from ages 0-22 get to learn about Jesus and what it means to follow Him in their everyday life.</p>

<h2 id="lite-bites">Lite Bites</h2>

<p>Lite Bites is a brunch that is held every Sunday from 10:00-11:00 in between services. This is a completely free way to fill your belly and meet some new friends or connect with those with which you are already in community.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>

<p>We all get together on Sundays to worship God. We do this in many ways. We sing songs to God which is a lot like prayers set to music. We share stories or testimonies of God’s love and power. We teach using the Bible as our authority, and from time to time remember the sacrifice Christ made for us through Communion.
Both buildings are handicap accessible.</p>
