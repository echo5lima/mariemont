4. COMMUNITY HELP LINE: If you have a need during this crisis, please email us at help@mariemontchurch.org and we will do our best to reply within an hour Monday-Friday between 9AM and 5PM and as soon as possible after normal business hours.

5. TEMPORARY OFFICE SPACE:  Many have been displaced to work at home and have no suitable place to work. We have a limited number of spaces for work and free internet. Please send a request to [mark@mariemontchurch.org](http://mark@mariemontchurch.org) and we will confirm with you that we have a safe place for you within 24 hours. You must be in good health and willing to observe our health protocol.

6. PRAYER MEETINGS: We are adding prayer meetings - Tuesdays at noon, Wednesdays at 7:30PM and Thursdays at 7AM - these meetings will start with 30 minutes of prayer - you will need to download the Zoom application on your computer. Then enter this code to join our prayer meetings: 829-125-2053.

7. OUR HEALTH PROTOCOL:

   1. Wash hands with soap or 60% alcohol aggressively - for 20 seconds (how long it takes to say the Lord's Prayer) before starting a new meeting, after entering a new location, before eating, after touching someone or a wet surface, after coughing or sneezing or of course, after using the toilet.

   2. Stay 5 feet away from non-immediate family members - practice social distancing wherever you go - don’t go to meetings that can’t accommodate this. Beware of coughing or sneezing people, and cover your own. Stay at home if sick.

   3. Disinfect common surfaces often throughout the day- kitchen counters, bathrooms, smartphones etc.

   4. Do not touch your face. The virus comes in micro moisture droplets that can live on hands and wet surfaces and can fly into your face with a cough or a sneeze, or get transported to your nose and lungs when you touch your face.

These 4 steps will keep you healthy and prevent you from spreading the virus - even in the event you didn’t know you had it - which is still a significant undefined problem with this virus.

Let’s all **focus on Jesus**, so we can live in love and not fear!

Update: March 13, 2020 at 12:30pm

Church Family,

MCC's Elders and Staff convened electronically yesterday--praise God for the technology--and reached the following decisions concerning the church assembling in the face of the Coronavirus.

For at least the next two weeks, MCC will NOT hold Sunday services at the Parish Center.
Instead, we will offer one service at 10:00 by streaming video from the MCC website. Source will be Denis and others of the church staff leading a family-oriented experience from Beausejour's home.

For the first Sunday at least, we will dispense with the current series on Idols and speak to the response of apprentices of Jesus and his body, the church, in times of crisis.

We will also suggest activities for families to do at home in conjunction with the streaming experience.
This decision was based on: 1) a desire to protect the flock by reducing contact and exposure inherent in church fellowship; 2) recommendations and requests of public officials to limit group meetings; and 3) the characteristics of the Coronavirus--longer incubation without symptoms and greater severity than typical flu viruses.

In order to participate in the Sunday morning experience go to the MCC website at 10:00 and follow directions there.

Further details and updates will be provided by multiple methods including the the MCC Facebook pages, the Mailchimp vehicle Denis uses for his weekly emails, and communication from Elders to their shepherding and small groups.

If you have questions or needs during this extraordinary period, please contact your Shepherding Elder or the church staff. In the meantime, let's be leaders in prayer, fasting and service for our community, nation and world.
