The series studies Paul’s last letters to his proteges Timothy and Titus, filled with wisdom for life today.

How did the Bible come to life in miracles of healing, prophecies, missions work, and individual transformation? But God!

How did a self-centered global business executive become a pastor? But God!

How did a little church in a little Village develop an amazing international ministry to tens of thousands? But God!

How did we renovate two historical buildings requiring an impossible $5 million budget, when our budget was only $500K? But God!
