OUR HEALTH PROTOCOL:

   a. Wash hands with soap or 60% alcohol aggressively - for 20 seconds (how long it takes to say the Lord's Prayer) before starting a new meeting, after entering a new location, before eating, after touching someone or a wet surface, after coughing or sneezing or of course, after using the toilet.

   b. Stay 6 feet away from non-immediate family members - practice social distancing wherever you go - don’t go to meetings that can’t accommodate this. Beware of coughing or sneezing people, and cover your own. Stay at home if sick.

   c. Disinfect common surfaces often throughout the day- kitchen counters, bathrooms, smartphones etc.

   d. Do not touch your face. The virus comes in micro moisture droplets that can live on hands and wet surfaces and can fly into your face with a cough or a sneeze, or get transported to your nose and lungs when you touch your face.

These 4 steps will keep you healthy and prevent you from spreading the virus - even in the event you didn’t know you had it - which is still a significant undefined problem with this virus.

**LETS KEEP DOING THE 5 TOGETHER!**

1 **HANDS**-Wash them often for 20 seconds

2 **ELBOW**-Cough or sneeze into it

3 **FACE**-Don't touch it!

4 **FEET**-Stay more than 6ft apart

5 **FEEL**-sick? Stay home


Let’s all **focus on Jesus**, so we can live in love and not fear!

But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. Jeremiah 29:7
