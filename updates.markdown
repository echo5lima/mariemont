## Community Updates

<span class="timestamp">Latest Update: March 13, 2020 at 12:30pm</span>

Church Family,

MCC's Elders and Staff convened electronically yesterday--praise God for the technology--and reached the following decisions concerning the church assembling in the face of the Coronavirus.

For at least the next two weeks, MCC will NOT hold Sunday services at the Parish Center.
Instead, we will offer one service at 10:00 by streaming video from the MCC website. Source will be Denis and others of the church staff leading a family-oriented experience from Beausejour's home.

For the first Sunday at least, we will dispense with the current series on Idols and speak to the response of apprentices of Jesus and his body, the church, in times of crisis.

We will also suggest activities for families to do at home in conjunction with the streaming experience.
This decision was based on: 1) a desire to protect the flock by reducing contact and exposure inherent in church fellowship; 2) recommendations and requests of public officials to limit group meetings; and 3) the characteristics of the Coronavirus--longer incubation without symptoms and greater severity than typical flu viruses.

In order to participate in the Sunday morning experience go to the MCC website at 10:00 and follow directions there.

Further details and updates will be provided by multiple methods including the the MCC Facebook pages, the Mailchimp vehicle Denis uses for his weekly emails, and communication from Elders to their shepherding and small groups.

If you have questions or needs during this extraordinary period, please contact your Shepherding Elder or the church staff. In the meantime, let's be leaders in prayer, fasting and service for our community, nation and world.
