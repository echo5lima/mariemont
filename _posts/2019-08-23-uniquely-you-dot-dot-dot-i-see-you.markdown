They say that the eyes are the window to the soul
There is some truth to that,
Because not only do our eyes take in our experiences
They can tell a story
Your eyes tell YOUR story and HIS story
I have seen God’s glory covering you
Covering you like a boxer's robe 
Your eyes have the intensity of a fighter
The confident exterior of a warrior 
Head nodding in silent prayer 
For the upcoming warfare
Not phased by the enemies stare
Your eyes are constantly aware
Of what is going on around you in this ring of life
Instead of throwing your hands 
You spit fire
Words rage like a viking funeral pyre
Yet, your flow has a hypnotic rhythm and pace
Bobbing and weaving through lyrics with grace
All in a posture of praise

Because you are still HERE
Behind your confident exterior used to be fear
Fear that you weren’t enough
Fear that you wouldn’t measure up
Fear that you were alone
And wouldn’t live long enough to be grown
Fear of sin known and unknown
The darkness surrounding
Your heart was pounding, sounding an alarm
About to commit self-harm

Walking a razor blade tightrope 
Searching for light, searching for hope
You started running FROM the lie
That you were ready to DIE
Instead you chose life

Dwelling in the shelter of the Most High!
He will command his Angels concerning YOU!
To guard you in all your ways
Because He has a purpose for the rest of your days

No more greys, your LIGHT is sun-soaked rays
Oozing with praise
He prepared you to teach the underserved 
Heart so big it’s not easily unnerved 
Teaching students to reach for the stars 
And reject those jail bars
Whether literal prison or the twisting turning labyrinth of fear and hopelessness
He SAVED you for this!
Saved you with His BLOOD

No need for another flood
He put his arms out freely and they nailed...one...two...three
Unbelievable agony all for you and for me
I mean…

 
They  say Eyes Are the Windows to the Soul 

And yours Are a Kaleidoscope Of the Creation

I see God Hovering Over the Waters Of your Tears With Hope Bursting 
From A Broken Bloodline Into The First Breath Of A Relationship With Him

That He has Spoken To exist In you; His Word Is Bond.
And His Mouth Is Pregnant; With Every Whisper,
The Content Of His Heart Toward You Is dilating

Stretching "Let There Be"To "It Is Finished"

Like A Cross-Stitched Conversation With Himself From Start To Finish.

His Death Has Wetnursed Your Rebirth Before The Beginning.

And since then His Breath Has been Spilling Light Into Your lungs Like Suicidal Stars
Dripping From His Lips Into The Waterfall Of A First Word
That is Washing Unfertilized Confessions Of Who You really are. 

Gardens Can't grow
Grounded In their Own Guilt.

But we Forget: Pruning Is a process

And for years You've flower-bedded Forgiveness For yourself
Inside Of a eulogy That never Knew it Could blossom
With the Fruit of Your lips. 
Flowers Like us know 
That it hurts To open up. 

But you Did it anyway
Believing That what Goes Down
Must come Up, if it's rooted In the right Belief. 

So now, You reach Toward Green-housed Heavens
To show That first Fruits Don't stay Buried
Because Cross-Pollinated Seeds Like you And me Always Come Together,

When They're Growing in The same Direction.

“For the Lord sees not as man sees:

Justin
man looks on the outward appearance, 

All
but the Lord looks at the heart.”

Justin
So, Tell Me…

All
What do You see?

Rob
You say that you are colorblind...

Justin
That you Wear The Wool
Of Mary's Little Lamb
Over Your eyes So you Can't see
Segregated Shades Of lost Sheep

Rob
We Graze By faith And not By sight

All
But how Are we Supposed To walk the walk
When our Gospel Has no Feet?

Rob
We can’t repeat the sins of our fathers
Who sat idle And didn’t take the bridle

All
They let Satan lead

Justin
We must take the reins

All
Because  His
Blood is in our veins 

Rob
So, We urge 
Us all to…

All
Bear with one 
Another in love

Justin
To maintain... 

All
Unity of 
The Spirit

Rob 
One body, 
One Spirit,
One Hope, 

Justin
One Lord,
One Faith, 
One Baptism,

All
One God and Father of all
Who is over all 
And through all and in all.
