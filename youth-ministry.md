### What We Believe About Students

Did you know that the first youth pastor in the Christian church may have been Jesus? What a lot of people don’t know about Jesus’ original 12 disciples, is that it’s quite possible 11 of the 12 of them were teenagers, or at least younger than 20 based on the absence of paying the temple tax mentioned in Matthew 17. 

The fact that they were following a Rabbi and Jesus’ reference to them as “little ones” or little children” in Matthew 11, Luke 10, and John 13 support that they were youth.

The main point we draw from this is that there is no "junior Holy Spirit." The Father is happy to use anyone who makes themselves available for Kingdom works; so when we look at our students, we see Disciples of Jesus with gifting, power, authority, and purpose as disciples of Jesus.

### **What are our meetings like?**

We meet in the 3rd floor youth room and spend some time hanging out, playing games, and eating snacks until we begin a group game.  After the group game, we listen to a speaker, and then break into middle school and high school small groups with a youth staff member. 

Many times in these small groups students will encourage, listen to, and pray for each other.
 
We have students from the tristate area who attend public, private, and home-schools. We also have some wonderful adult leaders who love Jesus, love students, and have a desire to see students walk more deeply and intentionally with Jesus.

### **Who Can Come?**

Any 6th–12th grade student no matter where you go to school. You don’t have to attend MC to come. In fact, you don’t have to believe in God. This is a safe place to come and explore your faith no matter where you are on your journey. We encourage our students to bring their friends from all walks of life.
