### 2021 Women’s Retreat

Mariemont Church Women’s Retreat is to help women grow in their faith by focusing on a topic and building relationships among women. The retreat environment enables connections, trust and deeper sharing among the women.

**February 6, 2021** is the date for this year's retreat.

**Finding Shalom Amidst Chaos**

Have you been feeling anxious? Are you weary from the chaos the world has brought this past year? Our Women's Retreat, Finding Shalom Amidst Chaos, will be held Saturday, Feb. 6, 2021, from 10:00 am to 3:30 pm. Beth Guckenberger will share eight ancient Hebrew words to help bring completeness and peace to our souls in this stormy time.

The retreat will be both in-person and live stream, similar to our Sunday services. It will be free of charge and includes a box lunch for those attending in-person. No childcare will be provided.

January 23 is the deadline to RSVP to Paula Ayer at ayerpaula@gmail.com. Reservations will be on a first-come first-served basics. Feel free to invite a friend or a relative.

If you would like to attend the retreat via live stream, we also need a reservation so you can receive details and information. RSVP, by January 23, to Paula Ayer, ayerpaula@gmail.com. Please consider inviting a friend or family member to participate with you, in your home, if you feel comfortable.

Looking forward to being in His presence with you!
