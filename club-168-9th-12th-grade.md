Our Senior High Ministry is called Club 168. The 168 comes from the idea that there are 168 hours in a week, and we want to live for Christ all 168 hours, not just the few hours we are at Youth meetings or Sunday mornings at community gatherings. The Scripture that speaks to this is  1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 --16 Always be joyful.--17 Never stop praying.--18 Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.

We meet on Wednesday nights in our student ministry's room called “The Rock” on the 2nd floor, from 7:00 – 8:30. A typical night will consist of food and drinks, some fun games, worship, sharing, and small group breakouts. Many times in these small groups students will encourage, listen to and pray for each other.

We have students who go to Mariemont Schools, Turpin schools, MVCA and many home-schooled students from various co-ops. We also have some wonderful adult leaders who love Jesus, love students, and have a desire to see students walk more deeply and intentionally with Jesus.
