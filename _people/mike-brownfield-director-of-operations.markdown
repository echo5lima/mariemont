I love the vision and mission of Mariemont Church.  I was born and raised in the Cincinnati area, accepted Christ in my early twenties and have been a Jesus follower ever since. My desire is to use the gifts God has given me to serve others and further God's Kingdom.
After 33 years working in the engineering field, I wanted a career change and shared my heart's desire with God. I hadn't expected this would lead to a full time church position but was thrilled when He brought it all together in the most unexpected way. I've performed the operational side of church work in the past mostly part-time or voluntarily and really get energized by it. MC has a great team of staff and volunteers so I'm really excited to be part of it. 
I am married to the lovely Renee and have 3 children and 4 grandchildren.
