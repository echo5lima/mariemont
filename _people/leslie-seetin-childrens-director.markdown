Leslie has been the director of MCC Kids since 2016. She was born and raised in Cincinnati and has called MCC her home church since first grade, even with a four-year stint at Indiana University, followed by six years in Colorado Springs. She is married to Rob, and their three boys—Abe, Sam, and Joshie—have taught them more about monster trucks, mowing the lawn, and loud noises than they could ever imagine.
