Hi there! My name is Katie Smith and I get the awesome privilege of serving our church as the Director of Children’s Ministry.  I love facilitating a true experience of Jesus - our kids pray for one another, practice hearing from God and learn about their mission to bring the Kingdom of God to those around them! I also love bringing families together to develop deep, life-giving community.  
I have worked as the Director of the After-School Program at CHCA Otto Armleder, I’ve been on staff with Cru, and I’ve taught positive culture building skills with Perfect 10 Corporate Cultures.  I married Jeremy in 2008, a Cincinnati fireman who runs into fiery buildings for a living! Now I am a mom to Nick and Aubreigh. I love playing golf in my super cute golf shoes, playing pickleball with my family and exploring the country in our Skoolie!
