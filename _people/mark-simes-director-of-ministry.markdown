Mark Simes has served as the Director of Ministry since 2016.  He is responsible for the church's finances, facilities, communications, volunteer ministry, and other administrative functions.  At age 25 Mark decided to follow Jesus Christ and has been pursuing Jesus' approach to all the dimensions of life:  faith, family, friends, fitness, finances, fun, and vocation. Mark and Holly have been married for 29 years and have two adult sons who both live out of state.  Last year Mark and Holly moved to a cute little house just two blocks from the church.  Mark's special interests are discipling men, running, all sports, home improvement projects, and reading books about God and leadership.
