 Hello.  My name is Renee Brownfield, and for 25 years, it has been my honor to be the director of our church preschool and elementary extended care ministry programs.   I'm a home town girl.  I grew up in the small village of Fairfax, attended Mariemont Junior and Senior high school, and then went to Eastern Kentucky University, where I received a bachelor's degree in early child education.
     I have so many things in my life to be thankful for.  I have a wonderful husband, Mike, three step children, and one grandchild.  I feel very blessed to be apart of our church staff team.  We have a lot of fun together, truly love each other, and offer lots of grace.  There's a lot of energy and creativity that flows through out veins. It's exciting and rewarding to be part of the team.
