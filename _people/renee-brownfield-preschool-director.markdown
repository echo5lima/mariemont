 Renee Brownfield has been on the church staff since 1994. She's a home town girl who grew up in the small village of Fairfax, attended Mariemont Junior and Senior high school, and then went to Eastern Kentucky University where she received a bachelor's degree in early childhood education. Renee loves to spend time with her family, travel and attending sporting events. The creativity of the staff is the biggest reason why she enjoys serving with the church.
