In the Fall of 2015, I attended a teaching one night at MC, and although I had never been here before, I knew the Spirit was calling my family. We started attending and in 2016 began to lead an MCC NKY Small Group where the Lord has kept us in an incubator of prayer and worship ever since.  We also had the opportunity to help start the Family Camp at MC. In this church family we have learned to confess, repent, and worship the Lord in a richer way than ever before. Our eyes have been open to the greater spiritual world increasing our vision and discernment into the Kingdom and the battles they present the church. 
I have learned the Spirit wants to move and speak, and we are learning how to position ourselves to allow His will to be done. Under the leadership at MCC, I have learned that the Lord’s journey in our lives is a continual loving process of relinquishing our will, renewing our minds, and healing our hearts so that we can conform to Christ and reach Abba’s sons & daughters. I am filled with the anticipation and hope of His relentless pursuits.
