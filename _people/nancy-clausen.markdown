Nancy joined our staff in January of 2023 after moving from California to be near "framily" (friends like family).  She brings years of experience in marketing and the publishing industry including 18 years at Tyndale House Publishers where she was Senior Director of Marketing. At Mariemont Church she manages communications and finances in addition to a lot of other office "stuff."  She loves animals, swimming and snorkeling, and when she can, kayaking. Most importantly, she loves God, and is thankful to be working with amazing people in a place where that is the top priority!
