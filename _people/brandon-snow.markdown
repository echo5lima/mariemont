I began attending MCC in July of 2011, where I have experienced exponential growth as a man, husband, and father. Back in 2012-2013, I co-led 2 different Story Formed Life small groups. Laura and I have led a few other small groups in the years since, including a DMM study with a neighbor, pre-Covid. We have also engaged in some family-oriented events, like a version of a church picnic, and started and led Family Camp. I regularly volunteer to run the soundboard for Sunday worship services and am an occasional volunteer for children’s Sunday School.

I married Laura in December 2011. We now have 4 sons: Luke, Levi, Liam, and Lincoln. In 2020, at the dinner table, we were reading the story of Nicodemus’ interaction with Jesus, Luke accepted Christ for the first time and was baptized about 2 months later. What a gift!

Laura and I have been especially blessed to have been built into by some really incredible spirit-led leaders. We look forward to many more years of this, as well as having more opportunities to disciple others in the Lord.
