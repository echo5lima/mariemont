**Welcome to Mariemont Church’s Kingdom Kids!**

Kingdom Kids is a place where our kids are given the opportunity to encounter and know Jesus so they can be empowered by the Spirit to bring the Kingdom of God to those around them.

* Our kids get to know God as Father, Friend and Savior.
* We surround our kids with adults who love Jesus and who love them.
* We have FUN!

‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.’ Acts 2:17

**Is this your first time?** 
Welcome! Come to the Check-In Desk on the Lower Level. Signs (and children’s voices) will direct you to the correct spot. You can also park around the back of the building and enter through the Kids Entrance with the awning (closer to the tennis courts). Receive security name badges, and walk with your child to their classroom. A friendly Supervisor is on hand to help you find your way.

***For the families that consider MCC their home, be ready to engage with our kids Sunday mornings! We need greeters, teachers, teaching assistants, nursery care along with outreach dreamers!  Our goal is 100% volunteer participation from each of our families!

**Beyond Sundays**
Here at Mariemont Church, we deeply value community.  In order for our families to experience deeper relationships between parents, church members and our children, we create space for engagement outside of Sunday mornings.
