## Welcome to Kingdom Kids!

Kingdom Kids is a place where our kids are given the opportunity to encounter and know Jesus so they can be empowered by the Spirit to bring the Kingdom of God to those around them.

* Our kids get to know God as Father, Friend and Savior.
* We surround our kids with adults who love Jesus and who love them.
* We have *FUN*!

**‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.’ Acts 2:17**

#### Is this your first time?
Welcome! Come to the Check-In Desk on the Lower Level. Signs (and children’s voices) will direct you to the correct spot. You can also park around the back of the building and enter through the Kids Entrance with the awning (closer to the tennis courts). Receive security name badges, and walk with your child to their classroom. A friendly Supervisor is on hand to help you find your way.

## 2023 Sunday Morning Class Offerings

**Pick-Up**:  Be sure to keep your parent badge for pick up after the service. To be kind to our teachers and child care helpers, we try to make sure kids are picked up by 10:20 a.m. after the 9:00 Service, and picked up by 12:20 p.m. after the 11:00 service.  Sometimes the Spirit leads and the service is not yet over by those times, but people will understand if you sneak out quietly before it's over.  You can return to the service with your child!

**Note**: Sometimes due to circumstances beyond our control, we need to cancel a class on Sunday mornings.  Check with the Connect Desk in the Main Floor Lobby or the Welcome Center on the Lower/1st Floor to find out if your class has been cancelled.

### **Consider Serving**

For the families that consider Mariemont Church their home, be ready to engage with our kids Sunday mornings! We need greeters, teachers, teaching assistants, nursery care along with outreach dreamers!  Our goal is 100% volunteer participation from each of our families!

##  Beyond Sundays
Here at Mariemont Church, we deeply value community.  In order for our families to experience deeper relationships between parents, church members, and our children, we create space for engagement outside of Sunday mornings.  Watch this space for news about Kingdom Kids gatherings and events.

### **April 2023**

*** April 16 - Baby Dedications during the services.** Contact Katie Smith at katie@mariemontchurch.org to sign up or receive more information.
