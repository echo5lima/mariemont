**Mariemont Church Kids!**

Mariemont Church is committed to raising up strong, spiritually healthy children. From 6 months to 6th grade, we are empowering families to lead children in developing their own faith in Christ and to live out their faith in very real ways!

‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.’    Acts 2:17

**Sunday Morning Check-In Process**

***NEW!**  You can check in from your breakfast table (if you actually make it there before church!) or from your car!  Open the Church Center App and click on the “check-in” tab.  Tap each child who will be attending When you arrive show it to the Kids Supervisor, and the tags will print!

**Is this your first time? ** Welcome!  Come to the Check-In Desk on the Lower Level.  Signs (and children’s voices) will direct you to the correct spot.  You can also park around back and enter through the back door with an awning (closer to the tennis courts).   
Receive security name badges, and walk with your child to their classroom. A friendly supervisor is on hand to help you find your way.
