**Welcome to Mariemont Church’s Kingdom Kids!**

We are committed to raising strong, spiritually healthy children. From 6 months to 6th grade, we are empowering families to lead children in developing their own faith in Christ and to live out their faith in very real ways!

‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.’ Acts 2:17

**Is this your first time?**

Welcome! Come to the Check-In Desk on the Lower Level. Signs (and children’s voices) will direct you to the correct spot. You can also park around the back of the building and enter through the Kids Entrance with the awning (closer to the tennis courts). Receive security name badges, and walk with your child to their classroom. A friendly Supervisor is on hand to help you find your way.

***For the families that consider MCC their home, be ready to engage with our kids Sunday mornings! We need greeters, teachers, teaching assistants, nursery care along with outreach dreamers!  Our goal is 100% volunteer participation from each of our families!

**Beyond Sundays**

Here at Mariemont Church, we deeply value community.  In order for our families to experience deeper relationships between parents, church members and our children, we create space for engagement outside of Sunday mornings.

This page will be updated as we get settled on the dates!  If you are interested in joining us and would like more details, please contact Katie Smith at 513-205-8539 or [katie@mariemontchurch.org](katie@mariemontchurch.org)
