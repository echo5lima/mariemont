## Welcome to Kingdom Kids!

Kingdom Kids is a place where our kids (infants through grade 5) are given the opportunity to encounter and know Jesus so they can be empowered by the Spirit to bring the Kingdom of God to those around them.

* Our kids get to know God as Father, Friend and Savior.
* We surround our kids with adults who love Jesus and who love them.
* We have *FUN*!

**‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.’ Acts 2:17**

** Is this your first time?**
Welcome! Come to the Check-In Desk on the Lower Level. Signs (and children’s voices) will direct you to the correct spot. You can also park around the back of the building and enter through the Kids Entrance with the awning (closer to the tennis courts). Receive security name badges, and walk with your child to their classroom. A friendly Supervisor is on hand to help you find your way.

**Pick-Up**: Kingdom Kids is over as soon as the main service ends. Please pick your kids up at this time with the security sticker. If you would like prayer or if there is something preventing you from coming to the classroom immediately, give your security sticker to a trusted adult and they can help you out! 

**Note**: Sometimes due to circumstances beyond our control, we need to cancel a class on Sunday mornings.  Check with the Connect Desk in the Main Floor Lobby or the Welcome Center on the Lower/1st Floor to find out if your class has been cancelled.

### **Consider Serving**

For the families that consider Mariemont Church their home, be ready to engage with our kids Sunday mornings! We need greeters, teachers, teaching assistants, nursery care along with outreach dreamers!  Our goal is 100% volunteer participation from each of our families!

##  Beyond Sundays
Here at Mariemont Church, we deeply value community.  In order for our families to experience deeper relationships between parents, church members, and our children, we create space for engagement outside of Sunday mornings.  Watch this space for news about Kingdom Kids gatherings and events.


**Note**: All details are subject to change (and often do!). If you would like to keep up-to-date on all things Kingdom Kids, contact Katie Smith at 513-205-8539 or katie@mariemontchurch.org and she'll put you on her Kingdom Kids email list. She'd love to hear from you!
