The New Testament does not speak directly about church membership, but the letters of the Apostles clearly assume that each person is engaged in a local church body. For our membership process, we ask each person to do a five-day Bible study on the commands of Jesus and the letters of the Apostles, learning about the commitments that Jesus requires as we follow him. Itâ€™s ultimately between each of us and Jesus. For those who testify to the grace of Jesus in their lives, and those ready to make these biblical commitments - you are received into membership here as we follow Jesus together.
