### To book the chapel for weddings, please fill out our [online wedding inquiry](/wedding-form). 

## Eligibility
We receive many requests for the use of the Memorial Chapel for weddings. Members of Mariemont Church and people who regularly attend MC receive priority in booking weddings, as well as residents of the Village of Mariemont and former residents and members. Other requests will be considered as availability allows.

### Premarital Counseling
Marital satisfaction and longevity are greatest for couples who purposefully prepare for marriage. For this reason, we require couples to complete a four to six month, comprehensive marriage preparation process with a mentoring couple. Wedding dates should be planned to allow adequate time for this important step. If you are not being married by a Mariemont Community Church pastor, your officiant may do your premarital counseling. All couples are required to go through premarital counseling before their wedding.

### Premarital Purity
God instituted marriage as a committed relationship between one man and one woman. It is the only relationship in which sex was intended to be enjoyed. For this reason, we ask that couples abstain from sexual activity until their wedding day. We ask that Mariemont Church couples sign a Purity Promise. Please ask for a copy of our Purity Promise for more information on this policy. We generally do not marry couples who are cohabiting or have been previously married unless there are extenuating circumstances. 

### Wedding Ceremony
Mariemont Church pastors or others who have been approved by the Council of Elders may officiate at weddings in the Memorial Chapel. Your officiating pastor will meet with you to help plan your ceremony and approve all service details.
Once the officiant has been chosen, we can discuss your date choice, then you will receive an email with additional information and forms. (Additional approval is required for if you are using another officiant). Contact us if you have any questions. Weddings are scheduled by the Church Administrator. After your date has been approved, the receipt of one half the fee and your signed Wedding Data Sheet will secure your date on our calendar.

### Fees
Please contact Terri Cofskey, part-time Administrator, with questions. Send an email inquiry to terri@mariemontchurch.org.
