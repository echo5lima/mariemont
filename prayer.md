**Overview**

Prayer undergirds our entire foundation at Mariemont Community Church.  We encourage everyone to have their own prayer time at home.  We also encourage reading Scripture.  In fact, the 'Read Scripture' app is a great resource for those of us on the go.  You sequentially read a portion of Scripture, and then move into a time of prayer and meditation on the Psalm for the day.

**Wednesday Night Prayer**

Every Wednesday night intercessors and anyone interested in praying get together from 7:00-8:00 pm in the Hearth Room located on the left of the building adjacent to the offices.  We also have worship at 6:15 for those who are interested.  All are welcomed.  We generally start with a devotion, followed by prayer for Mariemont Community Church, the village of Mariemont, the city of Cincinnati, for the nation and her leaders, then on to our missionaries, Israel and any individual personal concerns.  If you are interested, we would love to have you join us.  No pressure to engage until you feel comfortable. Please direct any questions to Marianne Beausejour at mebeau@gmail.com.

**Prayer Chain**

When someone has a need for prayer we would love to be involved.  We have many people who will lift you, your family, and your concerns to the Lord.  We appreciate updates and hearing of answered prayers so that we can give praises to the Lord for His grace.  It also builds our faith to hear all the ways the Lord is working through our prayer.

Please direct your email to Amy Taylor at theamytaylor@gmail.com, and she will alert the team.  If you would prefer to call, please call Terri Cofskey at the church and leave a message, if she is not available.  Terri's number is (513) 271-4376 ext.104.

**Prayer Shifts in the Upper Room**

The Upper Room is where we pray daily and weekly on the third floor of the church.  We have about 60 hours a week covered currently.  We schedule people from one-half hour to 2 hours each week... whatever works best for you.  

There are prayer binders with lots of Scriptures, prayers, and details about our congregation, ministries, missionaries, as well as the city, state and federal government.  It would be impossible to pray through most of the tabs within a two hour session. But, it is a blessing to pray for all the issues that involve Mariemont and beyond.

**Elder Prayer**

Consistent with the Bible in James 5:14, the Elders will pray with anyone who is sick and in need of prayer.   A time will be scheduled for you to receive prayer.  Please email Terri Cofskey at terri@mariemontchurch.org to schedule.

**Sunday Service Prayer**

On Sundays at the conclusion of each service, there are prayer teams at the front of the church whom you can go to for prayer.  If you are interested, you can serve on a prayer team too.  Periodically, there are training days to deepen your personal prayer time and intercession skills.  Please contact Marianne Beausejour for more information at mebeau@gmail.com.

**Inner Healing Prayer and Soul Care**

The Pastor Care Team makes personal visits in groups of two.  Team members want to effectively minister the love, grace, and mercy of Jesus Christ and bring the kingdom of God into each personal encounter.  Please contact Donna Painter for more information and to make an appointment at donna@mariemontchurch.org

Separately, Donna Painter offers inner healing prayer sessions, called "Soul Care," by appointment only at the church to any member seeking help with unhealed emotional issues.  Another member of the team will also be present.   Please contact Donna Painter to make an appointment at donna@mariemontchurch.org


**Prayer Requests** 

There is also a box in the lobby for you to make prayer requests.  We will distribute them to the prayer chain and available in the Upper Room for prayer.
