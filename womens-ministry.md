The vision of the Mariemont Church Women’s Ministry is to encourage women of all ages to grow in their faith and equip them to be beacons of light in their homes, communities and workplaces. This is accomplished by providing opportunities for growth through study, service and warm fellowship with one another. Additionally, Women’s Ministries strives to help women mature in their faith by strengthening the bonds with one another.

## Equipping

Sharing the goal of having every member grow through participation in Bible study, Women’s Ministries offers a variety of studies for women in the church and women who may not be members of Mariemont Church. Studies are Bible based, providing perspectives for applying Christian principles to a woman’s life, and are typically taught by women from our community.

**Finding Shalom Amidst Chaos** was our 2021 retreat. Beth Guckenberger shared seven ancient Hebrew words that helped bring completeness and peace to our souls in this stormy time.

The retreat was both in-person and live streamed. You can access the three videos on Mariemont Church's YouTube channel [here (1)](https://youtu.be/p1MRw42YHRA), [here (2)](https://youtu.be/IHLUDYp1AUo), and [here (3)](https://youtu.be/b2SPeXkzX9c).


### Serve

Everyone is encouraged to utilize their spiritual gifts and serve God in many capacities in the church, whether in the office, teaching children, worship team, or many other areas. There are several specific areas of service:

### The Family Shop

For over 25 years, Women’s Ministries has provided affordable second-hand clothing to those in need; both for sale and then free to missionaries or relief organizations. Volunteers use this clothing ministry as a means of reaching people by providing needed clothing and as opportunities arise, sharing the Gospel message. The proceeds of the sales are used to support Women’s Ministries, outreach to under-served women in the local community (ie. Prison Ministries – Ohio Reformatory for Women’s Tapestry and Kairos programs) and also for projects within the church.

The Family Shop, located at the rear of the Parish Center, is open the second and fourth Saturdays of each month from 9 a.m. until noon.

### Take Them A Meal (Food Chain)

Take Them A Meal is an outreach food ministry to MCC church members who are in need of meals on a temporary basis due to surgery, illness, newborns, etc. Those in need contact Brittany Harrison brittany.harrison19@gmail.com or Terry Robinson dbrtpr@gmail.com. Scheduling will be set up on the Internet through Takethemameal.com, and volunteers are advised of the specific needs and sign up accordingly. Three meals per week for two weeks are provided, but additional meals can be requested.

### Tapestry of Love (Prison Ministry)

Tapestry of Love is a ministry founded by Sheila Luther and Teresa Earhart. Our mission is to encourage the incarcerated women and show them the unconditional love of Jesus so they will know that through Jesus there is restoration and unconditional forgiveness for all who seek Him.

During the pandemic, while the prisons remain closed to outside volunteers, we connect the incarcerated women in several ways including school supply mailings to their children. These children are often a forgotten population when their mothers go to prison and leave them behind in someone else's care. A first day of school without their mother or spending a holiday without mom is incredibly sad. Children can’t visit with their moms, the mothers long to reach out to their children, so we are connecting them through school supplies and Christmas gift mailings until the pandemic is over.

Caregivers of the children are another focus of our ministry. We show love to the caregivers and supporters of these children left behind. Additionally, we help women coming out of prison with clothing and other vital needs to successfully re-enter society.

Sheila Luther, who spent 13 years in prison and the founder of Tapestry of Love, is the illustrator of a book titled, *How Mommy Found Her Way Home*. For more information and to support this children’s book go to [www.seednhope.com](https://seed hope.com/).

The mission of the Tapestry ministry is to show love and compassion to the “least of these” as the Bible tells us we must do in Matthew 25, “Whenever you do it for the *least of these*, you do it for me."
