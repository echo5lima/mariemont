## A Vision to Encourage and Equip

<img src="/uploads/Women's%20Ministry%20Logo%202500.png" alt="Women's Ministry Logo 2500.png" style="max-width: 280px; text-align: left; float: left;" width="280px">

The vision of the Mariemont Church Women’s Ministry is to encourage women of all ages to grow in their faith and equip them to be beacons of light in their homes, communities and workplaces. This is accomplished by providing opportunities for growth through study, service and warm fellowship with one another.

Sharing the goal of having every member grow through participation in Bible study, Women’s Ministries offers a variety of studies for women in the church and women who may not be members of Mariemont Church. Studies are Bible-based, providing perspectives for applying Christian principles to a woman’s life, and are typically taught by women from our community.

## Bible Study and Fellowship

Come on a morning or evening and meet with other women for fellowship, discussion, and to grow deeper in your faith.

### Joy In The Morning 

**Winter Semester begins Tuesday Janaury 16**

This study takes place on Tuesday mornings 9:15-11:15 am in the Emery Room (Main/2nd Floor).

**Childcare during Joy in the Morning** for children of preschool age and under is available for $90 per child ($5 per child per week paid in advance). Contact Barb Leonard at  tombarbleonard@gmail.com to sign up.  There will be limited spaces.

**Study Options Include**:

**Jesus and Women: In the First Century and Now, a Bible Study by Kristi McLelland**

Facilitated by Beth Swift

Imagine walking the dusty roads of Galilee with Jesus of Nazareth—braving jostling crowds just to touch the edge of His cloak and hear Him say, “Take heart, daughter, your faith has healed you.” 

Those words, once meant to comfort a hurting woman’s soul thousands of years ago, were also meant for you. 

Join biblical culturalist Kristi McLelland on those dusty roads as she transports you back to Jesus’ world, following in the footsteps of the women who came face-to-face with the Living God. 

Over 7 sessions, examine the historical and cultural climate of first-century Middle Eastern society to not only understand Jesus more deeply but to fuel your worship of Him today.

**Practicing the 9 Arts of Spiritual Conversations (A 9 Arts Curriculum)**

Facilitated by Jill Schellhause

How can conversations about God happen naturally with people all around you? Jesus engaged with people in a way that made spiritual conversations flow naturally. In his ministry there are nine practices that any Christian can live out to do the same. 

The 9 Arts Primer is Scripture-based curriculum to equip your small groups--or use on your own--to engage in meaningful conversations about God with people who believe differently. This practice guide is a companion to The 9 Arts of Spiritual Conversations book. 

In just ten weeks you can begin to experience the impact of noticing, praying, listening, asking questions, loving, welcoming, facilitating, serving together, and sharing--for deeper connections and life-changing conversations.

**Our Father, A Study of the Lord’s Prayer by Becky Harling**
Facilitated by Paula Ayer & Teresa Earhart

We are living in a time of increasing fear and depression, a time of disenchantment and disappointment. But there is healing for our souls in the Lord's Prayer. The Lord's Prayer not only teaches deep theology about our relationship with God but also about our relationship with others. 

Christians will come to repeat the Our Father prayer thoughtfully and lovingly. Join Becky Harling in reclaiming the beauty, boldness, and blessing offered to every believer through the Our Father prayer.

After immersing herself in the Lord's Prayer, author and Bible teacher Becky Harling found herself more deeply and profoundly in love with Jesus and passionate about following Him. In this 6-week Bible study, Becky shares six life-changing invitations that Jesus offers every believer through this prayer. Jesus warmly invites us:

* to know God as Father
* to worship
* to surrender
* to ask audaciously
* to find freedom through forgiveness
* to live victoriously

## SPECIAL EVENTS

### Annual Women’s Retreat

**Dates for the 2024 retreat are February 2-3 at the Jesuit Spiritual Center in Milford, Ohio.**


**Retreat Theme: Lay It All Down**

Are you tired? Do you feel burdened? Do your worries and concerns feel too heavy to carry? Come and be set free! Learn how Jesus wants you to feel free and not weighed down by concerns of this life and how to put into practice being free. We will learn about who Jesus says we are, why this matters to our lives, and how to practically walk out our freedom in Him together. Come and be ministered to by this amazing body of believers and by the Lord! He wants to set you free. Please join us for our annual Women’s Retreat, as Jess Moore teaches on how the Lord wants us to lay it all down and how to do this.

After completing her undergraduate degree at Missouri Valley College and attending on a soccer scholarship, she attended Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary to get her Master’s degree in counseling and psychology. Jess has practiced counseling since 2004 in various settings and several states and now owns her own private practice where she works to help people find healing and hope. 

Jess works with teenagers, young people, men, women, couples, and families.

She is gifted in the apostolic, prophetic and teaching gifts and loves ministering to other through these. Jess is married to Jamie, lead pastor at Mariemont Church, and they have two wonderful teenagers, Bailey and Caden. In her spare time, Jess loves to read, watch epic movies, workout at the gym, play sports of any kind, hang with the family, and play video games. Jess is particularly amazing at pickleball.

## Connect and Serve

Everyone is encouraged to utilize their spiritual gifts and serve God in many capacities in the church, whether in the office, teaching children, worship team, or many other areas. There are several specific areas of service:

### Take Them A Meal Food Ministry

Take Them A Meal is an outreach food ministry to MC church members and attenders who are in need of meals on a temporary basis due to difficult life circumstances such as surgery, illness, newborns, bereavement, moving, etc.

Those in need can contact:
Laura Snow at laurasnow3@gmail.com or Lynn Robinson at lcrobbie5@gmail.com.

Scheduling will be set up on the internet through TakeThemAMeal.com. Volunteers are advised of the specific needs and sign up accordingly. Three meals per week for two weeks are provided, but additional meals can be requested.

### Tapestry of Love Prison Ministry

Tapestry of Love is a ministry founded by Sheila Luther, with Teresa Earhart as partner. The mission is to encourage incarcerated women and their children by showing them the unconditional love of Jesus. Our prayer is that they will learn that there is restoration and unconditional forgiveness for all who seek Him. Our motivation to serve these women is Jesus Himself. 

He made it clear that showing love and compassion to the "least of these" is important. "Whenever you do it for the least of these, you do it for me." (Matthew 25:40)

Tapestry of Love connects the incarcerated women to the outside world in several ways including school supply mailings to their children. These children are often a forgotten population when their mothers go to prison and leave them behind in someone else’s care. A first day of school without their mother, or spending a holiday without mom, is incredibly sad. Tapestry of Love connects the incarcerated mother, grandmother, or relative with these children not only through school supply mailings, but also with gift mailings at Christmas.

Caregivers of the children are another focus of our ministry. The Christmas mailings allow us to show love to the inmates' caregivers, supporters, and relatives. Additionally, we help women coming out of prison with clothing and other vital needs to successfully re-enter society.

Tapestry of Love invites the whole congregation of Mariemont Church to get personally involved every year at Christmas when we lead a School Supply Drive and Adopt-a-Family for Christmas event.

For more information or for any questions, contact Sheila at tapestryoflove@mariemontchurch.org or Teresa at ttearhart@gmail.com. If you would like to support our ministry with your donation, send a check to Mariemont Church, 3908 Plainville Rd., 45227; with “Tapestry of Love,” in the memo line.

Colossians 2:12 “I want you woven into a tapestry of love, in touch with everything there is to know of God.”
