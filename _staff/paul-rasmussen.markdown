Paul “Raz” is the director of our “Loving in Jesus” ministries, which include Worship and Youth Ministry. Raz has a passion for helping followers of Christ connect with God in a meaningful way, and then taking that love for Christ outside of the church walls and into the streets. Raz has been in ministry for over 20 years in Colorado, Arizona, Texas and Ohio. Raz has been married to his wife Juli for 25 years, and they have three awesome sons. On days off you’ll find Raz playing with his family, and when the opportunity arises he might be found on a golf course, tennis court or perhaps fishing. Juli enjoys reading to “escape” from all the testosterone.
